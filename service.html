          <p>
            When first arriving at Texas A&M, I was looking into opportunities
            to connect and get involved with my peers in meaningful project and
            to simultaneously learn more about development to further my
            knowledge about computer science. I found that Aggie Coding Club was
            a great method for me to not only grow as a programmer but also
            offered the opportunity for me to work on teams that produced
            applications that were used on a daily basis by others.
            <br /><br />
            As a project manager, I was responsible for leading a team of
            developers to create a web application that would allow students to
            find study partners for their classes. This application, AggieSeek,
            was created to help students connect with others in their classes to
            facilitate group study sessions and collaborative learning. My role
            as a project manager involved coordinating the efforts of the team,
            setting deadlines, and ensuring that the project was completed on
            time and to a high standard. I also worked closely with the team to
            ensure that everyone was on the same page and that any issues or
            challenges were addressed promptly.
            <br /><br />
            It was a rewarding experience to see the project come to fruition
            and to know that it was helping students connect and succeed in
            their studies. Overall, my time as a project manager for Aggie
            Coding Club was a valuable learning experience that helped me
            develop my leadership and teamwork skills while also allowing me to
            contribute to a meaningful project.

            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tamu_badminton/?hl=en">Texas A&M Badminton Club Treasurer and Systems Administrator</a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            As Treasurer and Systems Administrator for the Texas A&M Badminton
            Club, I played a central role in both the financial and technical
            operations of one of the largest student organizations on campus. My
            work focused on creating sustainable systems that streamlined how
            the club handled its finances and tracked its members.
            <br /><br />
            I developed a custom in-house application that allowed officers to
            manage cash flow, dues collection, and administrative tasks more
            efficiently, replacing outdated manual processes. To support this, I
            implemented a relational database management system using SQL,
            ensuring prompt and accurate storage and retrieval of key
            information such as payments, attendance, and membership status.
            <br /><br />
            I collaborated with experienced database professionals and senior
            club officers to confirm that the system was both reliable and easy
            to use, focusing on accessibility for non-technical leaders. Through
            this collaboration, the application grew into a dependable tool that
            supported daily operations and long-term planning.
            <br /><br />
            During deployment, the system successfully facilitated the
            management of hundreds of active members, providing real-time
            updates on membership status and eligibility for tournaments,
            events, and practices. This ensured that leadership always had
            accurate, up-to-date information and allowed the club to operate
            more smoothly and transparently. Overall, my experience in this role
            gave me the opportunity to apply technical skills to a real-world
            setting while contributing meaningfully to the success of the
            organization.
